# Yasan Launcher
Minimalistic AI-powered Android launcher. This is a full rewrite of YASAN Launcher v3 using Jetpack Compose. Until this version is ready to be published, you can use [v3 on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yasan.space.mnml.ai.launcher).

## Usage
To be able to build the project you need to use the `open` flavor. The `close` flavor's source code is not included in this repository & it mainly holds the AI code & private keys.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
